# Customer-Analysis-Dashboard---Tableau
This is a Customer Analysis Dashboard which is created using Tableau Public - 2021.2.
The unique aspect of this project is that the template of it is created using Figma, which has given it a more customized look.
The project provides an answer for the following:
Revenue per state, revenue per month, revenue based on age, quantity and discount relation, revenue per category per gender.
The project has used charts like the maps, butterfly chart, line chart, scatter plot and histogram.
Utmost care has been taken to present the data in an unambiguious way by placing data labels at appropriate locations, using the correct measure of unit like $,
mentioning appropriate axis name, formatting the tooltip and so on.
The data is filtered using the region variable.
